(1, 'Unraveling the Legacy: Michael Jackson\'s \'Thriller\' and Its Enduring Impact', 'Jackson\'s previous album Off the Wall (1979) received critical acclaim and was a commercial success, having sold 10 million copies at the time.The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for Jackson, a time of increased independence. The period saw him become deeply unhappy; Jackson said, \"Even at home, I\'m lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It\'s so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he hired John Branca as his manager. Jackson told Branca that he wanted to be the biggest and wealthiest star in showbusiness. He was upset about what he perceived as the underperformance of Off the Wall, feeling it had deserved the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. He also felt undervalued by the music industry; in 1980, when Rolling Stone declined to run a cover story on him, Jackson responded: \"I\'ve been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn\'t sell copies ... Just wait. Some day those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I\'ll give them one, and maybe I won\'t.\"\r\n\r\nFor his next album, Jackson wanted to create an album where \"every song was a killer\". He was frustrated by albums that would have \"one good song, and the rest were like B-sides ... Why can\'t every one be like a hit song? Why can\'t every song be so great that people would want to buy it if you could release it as a single? ... That was my purpose for the next album.', 'THRILLER_michael_Jackson.jpg', 'sOnqjkJTMaA', 'Michael Jackson', 'Pop'),

It was written and composed by Jackson and produced by Quincy Jones and co-produced by Jackson. \"Billie Jean\" blends post-disco, R&B, funk, and dance-pop. The lyrics describe a woman, Billie Jean, who claims that the narrator is the father of her newborn son, which he denies. Jackson said the lyrics were based on groupies\' claims about his older brothers when he toured with them as the Jackson 5.\n\n\"Billie Jean\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topped the Billboard Hot Black Singles chart within three weeks, and became Jackson\'s fastest-rising number one single since \"ABC\", \"The Love You Save\" and \"I\'ll Be There\" in 1970, all of which he recorded as a member of the Jackson 5. It was also a number one hit in the UK, Canada, France, Switzerland and Belgium, and reached the top ten in many other countries. \"Billie Jean\" was one of the best-selling singles of 1983, helping Thriller become the best-selling album of all time, and became Jackson\'s best-selling solo single. \"Billie Jean\" is certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is one of the best-selling digital singles of all-time.\n\nJackson said that \"Billie Jean\" was based on groupies he and his brothers encountered while they performed as the Jackson 5. \"They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience [sic] with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\"\n\nAccording to Jackson\'s biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, \"Billie Jean\" was inspired by letters Jackson received in 1981 from a woman claiming he was the father of one of her twins. Jackson, who regularly received letters of this kind, had never met the woman and ignored those claims. However, she continued to send letters stating that she loved him and wanted to be with him, asking how he could ignore his own flesh and blood. The letters disturbed him so much that he began to suffer nightmares.\n\nEventually, Jackson received a parcel containing a photograph of the fan, a gun, and a letter instructing him to die at a particular time. The fan would do the same once she had killed \"their\" baby, so they could be together in the \"next life\". The Jacksons later discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.', 'Billie_Jean_Michael_Jackson.jpg', 'Zi_XLOBDo_Y', 'Michael Jackson', 'Pop'),

It has appeared on numerous greatest hits albums and was performed on all of Jackson\'s solo tours. \"Smooth Criminal\" was re-released in 2006 as a single as a part of Jackson\'s Visionary: The Video Singles boxset.\r\n\r\nIn the video, Jackson and the other dancers perform a lean that appears physically impossible. The dancers lean forward 45 degrees with their backs straight and feet flat on the floor, and hold the pose before returning upright. The lean moves the body\'s center of mass further than it can support. The illusion was achieved using cables and a harness. In October 1993, Jackson\'s team patented a method of performing the lean in concert using specially designed shoes that hook into pegs that rise from the stage. Even with the shoes, the move requires good athletic core strength.', 'Smooth_Criminal_Michael_Jackson.jpg', 'h_D3VFfhvs4', 'Michael Jackson', 'Pop'),

Keeping the gospel choir arrangement, the song was remixed for the soundtrack of Jackson\'s tribute tour Immortal.\r\n\r\nAn instrumental version of the song was played at the end of Jackson’s memorial service.\r\n\r\nWhen Ed Hogan reviewed the song, he called it \"gentle.\"Jon Pareles of The New York Times noted that this song has \"gospelly lift.\" Rolling Stone\'s Davitt Sigerson thought that \"Man in the Mirror\" stands among the half dozen best things Jackson has done: \"On \'Man in the Mirror,\' a song he did not write, Jackson goes a step further and offers a straightforward homily of personal commitment: \'I\'m starting with the man in the mirror/I\'m asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change.\' \"\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josh Tyrangiel from Time named \"Man in the Mirror\" among Jackson\'s ten best songs and \"one of Jackson’s most powerful vocals and accessible social statements, not to mention the best-ever use of a gospel choir in a pop song\".
